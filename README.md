# 545-team-project

India_weather_Hatta.csv   is what I use for my starting codes. Other csv files are just temporarily storing transformed dataframes.  

The folder "Office_Hours" contains my conversation with a TA on Aug 30. There is also a video to record what he has said, in which I show my not-very-good speaking English...

In the folder "Team_Project_Management", I have added a template for Gantt chart. Will update it later.
