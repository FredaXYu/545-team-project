## Datasets

India_weather_Hatta.csv   is what I use for my starting codes. Other csv files are just temporarily storing transformed dataframes.  

The source of this dataset: 
India 5000 cities weather https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mukeshdevrath007/indian-5000-cities-weather-data/data  It's a very big database, where I only take the csv file for Hatta city. 

## Github Folders

The folder "Office_Hours" contains my conversation with a TA on Aug 30. There is also a video to record what he has said, in which I show my not-very-good speaking English...

In the folder "Team_Project_Management", I have added a template for Gantt chart. Will update it later.
